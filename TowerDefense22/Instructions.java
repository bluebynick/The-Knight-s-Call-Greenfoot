/**This is a scrolling world class that holds the instructions to the game. 
 * By repositioning all the text actors realtive to the up or down buttons 
 * being clicked, I effectively made a scrolling world as the all the actors
 * move up when up is pressed or they move down when down is pressed. 
 * Basically there is an arraylist of lines and a 
 * int counter and offcounter. Counter is the index of the line that is
 * to be added to the screen from the bottom and offcounter is the index
 * of the line that should be added to the top should you scroll down. They
 * both increase or decrease relative to the amount of times the scroll up
 * or scroll down button is pressed and in the button functions method, it goes
 * through a for loop of the whole array, repositions what needs to be, removes
 * any at the top or bottom then adds the line at counter or offCounter. There 
 * is also a button to reset the instructions to the top by removeing all the
 * objects and reseting the counters. 
 * Pretty genius if i do say so myself,
 * and the best part of the whole thing is that i came up with it 100% by
 * myself. I'm proud!.

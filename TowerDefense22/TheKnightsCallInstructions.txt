The Knight's Call is a game focused on your kindgom's defense of your 
castle. The Saxon invaders have been knocking on camelot's door for 
years and the king has hired you as the new captain of defense to 
create a defenseive layout for the kingdom's towers. In this game 
you as the Captain will be given coins which you can allocate accordingly
to the creation of defensive towers.

On the mid left side of the screen the different tower options are 
displayed along with their coins cost. Normal towers that shoot normal 
bullets cost 50 and Magic Towers that shoot freezing bullets to stall 
enemy movement cost 100.  

If you chose to construct a certain tower, your coins will be reduced by 
the cost and a sprite will appear with the tower's range around it. You
must then drag the mouse (hold down mouse button on the sprite 
and move cursor) to the specified location where you'd like to place it. 

Enemies move down the black road path towards your Castle.

You cannot place a tower on the road or on top of another tower.

Towers automatically fire at the closest enemy. Towers can only fire
bullets within their square range outlined in blue. 

You can delete a tower once you've placed it by clicking directly upon
it. Your coins will not be returned. 

Starting with 100 coins, every saxon killed by one of your towers will
drop 10 coins which you can acquire by clicking with the mouse on the 
spinning icon. Coins can be used to created towers. 

At the end of every round a wizard will spawn to signify the end and 
once killed there will be a golden star dropped that increasees your 
normal bullet's damage. 

A new round will begin 3 seconds after the wizard. Enemy health and 
speed increases per round. 

Your level is displayed on top of your castle. 

You can exit and restart the game at any time by clicking back which
returns you to the menu screen.

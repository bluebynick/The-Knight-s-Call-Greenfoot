i wanted to make my game creative and unique so i made my ranges squares

next steps are to make sure that you've ddone all the must
->cooldown!!!

then do some may

then make the UI easier to understand, maybe put some text and some 
instructions

you should also have life

after that make two types of towers

next steps are to make the range a relative distance from the bullet's 
starting position.
